"It is up to you to make the necessary effort. When you are struggling to follow the book, do not jump to any conclusions about your own capabilities.
You are fine â€” you just need to keep at it[...] Learning is hard work, but everything you learn is yours and makes subsequent learning easier"

"When action grows unprofitable, gather information; when information grows unprofitable, sleep." Ursula K. Le Guin, The Left Hand of Darkness
